# Relocation of Lochness to Databank Datacenter

Dear Lochness Users,


We hope this message finds you well. We want to inform you of an upcoming significant event regarding our HPC (High-Performance Computing) cluster, lochness.njit.edu. The GITC datacenter is scheduled for demolition on November 1, 2023. In order to maintain the operation of our computing infrastructure, we will be relocating the cluster to the Databank colocation facility in Piscataway.


## Key Details:


* Cluster Shutdown Date: October 6th, 2023 at Noon
* Anticipated Duration: Up to Seven Days
* Operational Continuity: After the move the cluster will remain operational until the end of the semester.
* User Migration: We are actively working on migrating all users to the new cluster, wulver.njit.edu, before the end of the semester.


## Cluster Relocation Details:

The scheduled shutdown of the lochness.njit.edu cluster will take place on October 6th, 2023. We have estimated that the relocation process will require no longer than five days to complete. During this time, the cluster will not be accessible. We understand the importance of uninterrupted access to computational resources, and we will make every effort to minimize downtime.


## Operational Continuity:

Rest assured that we are committed to maintaining cluster availability for your research and academic needs. The lochness.njit.edu cluster will remain operational until the end of the current semester. This means that you will have access to its computing power throughout your ongoing projects and coursework.


## User Migration:

Our team is actively working on the migration process to ensure a smooth transition for all users. We plan to migrate all users to the new cluster, wulver.njit.edu, well before the end of the semester. Detailed instructions and support will be provided to facilitate this transition, and we will keep you updated on the migration progress.


We understand that this relocation may raise questions or concerns, and we are here to address them. Please feel free to reach out to hpc@njit.edu you have any specific inquiries or require further information.


We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transitional period. The relocation of our HPC cluster is aimed at providing you with an improved and more reliable computing environment.


Thank you for your ongoing support and contributions to our research community.
