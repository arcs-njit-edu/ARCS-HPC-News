# Lochness Maintenance Updates

!!! success "Lochness is Back Online!"

    Lochness is mostly back up after being moved to a new facility.  The move required complete disassembly and reassembly of the entire cluster. There are 8 nodes down as they were damaged in the move, repairs forthcoming. Infiniband network issues affect 50 nodes, these are in "drain" state. Currently 120 nodes are fully functional. You can use `sinfo` to see the exact states of nodes accessible to you. Please email [hpc@njit.edu](mailto:hpc@njit.edu) for assistance.
