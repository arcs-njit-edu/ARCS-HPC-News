# Wulver Maintenance

!!! warning "GPFS Fileset Changes"   
    
    Wulver will be out of service Wed Oct 18th between 9:00 am-11:00 am for updates and configuration changes. The maintence will be conducted to fix the `stale file handle` error on `/scratch` while accessing files from login node.
    
    # Maintencance Plans
    
    ## Recommendation:
    
    * Each fileset gets itâ€™s own inode namespace
      * Fileset names to automatically inherit pool policies
      * Additional fileset settings for chmod to not conflict with ACLs
    
    ## Migration Plan:
    
    * Create new filesets and link under /mmfs1/Scratch and /mmfs1/Project
        * New fileset names with sata1-project_xx and nvme1-scratch_xx (no bearing on FS path)
        * New fileset have own inode spaces
      * Rsync data from old to new location
      * Job outage for final copy and change
      * Final rsyncs
          * Remove symlink for /mmfs1/scratch and create /mmfs1/scratch
          * Unlink/relink filesets in new location
          * Resolve any links remaining on nodes/images
